function [output, act_h, act_a] = Forward(W, b, X)
% [OUT, act_h, act_a] = Forward(W, b, X) performs forward propogation on the
% input data 'X' uisng the network defined by weights and biases 'W' and 'b'
% (as generated by InitializeNetwork(..)).
% This function should return the final softmax output layer activations in OUT,
% as well as the hidden layer pre activations in 'act_a', and the hidden layer post
% activations in 'act_h'.
