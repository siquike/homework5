function [W, b] = InitializeNetwork(layers)
% InitializeNetwork([INPUT, HIDDEN1, HIDDEN2, ..., OUTPUT]) initializes the weights and biases
% for a fully connected neural network with input data size INPUT, output data
% size OUTPUT, and in between are the number of hidden units in each of the layers.
% It should return the cell arrays 'W' and 'b' which contain the randomly
% initialized weights and biases for this neural network.
